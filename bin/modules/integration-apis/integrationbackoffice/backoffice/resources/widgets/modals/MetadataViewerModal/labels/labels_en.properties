integrationbackoffice.metadata.jsonTooltip=These are dummy payloads generated dynamically using the Integration Object attributes. These examples provide only a sample structure for each payload. Each payload must be populated with data that, in certain cases, needs to be persisted and referenced. The end point may also expect a hook, which is not reflected in this dynamic payload example. Read-only and virtual attributes are excluded from the Persistence example payload.
